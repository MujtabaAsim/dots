<p align = "center">Endgame laptop rice (for now) with my first time using catppuccin. Liked it way more than expected. Was pleasantly surprised to see everything available in the official Catppuccin repository. Also included a (slightly) more robust polybar this time around and a custom ascii cat printing script. Just append it to bottom of your .bashrc.</p>
